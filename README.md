# Coming soon!
Currently not available as I sort out some issues with the fact that my project uses RtMidi virtual ports with loopMIDI which is not distributable and requires external software for this program to work. 
If anyone finds a way to migrate from loopMIDI to native Windows API please submit a pull request!
